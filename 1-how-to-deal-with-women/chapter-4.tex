\section{How to survive in the hard game of magnetic forces of seduction involving cheating females}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Do not own her. Forget about the idea that she is yours, specially if she says she is loyal, that you are the best guy whom she ever met, the one, etc.
	\item Until you have evidence proving otherwise, see her as a wonderful woman of many partners who does not ... by fear of social repression, but who needs a great friend to understand why she dates everyone.
	\item Do not fall to the temptation of seeing her as a celestial being. Never believe in her loyalty or that she does not flirt with anyone but you.
	\item Be indifferent to her games of contrary inconsistent behaviors.
	\item Kiss her passionately, as if you were full of feelings.
	\item Stop worrying about her loyalty. If she wants to fuck another man, no one will stop her.
	\item Do not annoy her and do not suffocate her with continuous displays of love.
	\item Do not be a dependent crying baby who cries for his mother.
